"""UserPromptSubmit hook: capture inbound channel messages into the rolling
transcript (direction='in') BEFORE the agent processes the prompt. Deterministic
and agent-independent. agent_id is derived from the session's cwd so the hook is
generic across all three channel agents and never cross-contaminates. Never
blocks the prompt (always exit 0).

PROVIDER-AGNOSTIC: every channel plugin emits the same <channel source="..">
envelope, so the capture matches any `plugin:<provider>:<name>` source rather
than one hardcoded provider. Hardcoding a single provider silently drops the
whole conversation on every other channel -- and the failure is invisible,
because the replay still produces a non-empty block from the one provider that
IS captured.

    """One line, and ONLY when the hook ran and stored nothing.

    WHY: every failure path in this hook is silent. A regex miss, a missing
    chat_id/message_id, a ledger exception and an unparseable payload all leave
    the same trace -- none. So "the hook never ran" and "it ran and matched
    nothing" are indistinguishable from outside, and a gap in the transcript
    cannot be attributed to either. That is not a gap in someone's diligence: it
    is a property of the code, and it makes the question unanswerable rather
    than merely unanswered.

    Measured on one install, 2026-09-04: in a 42-minute window the ledger held
    six outbound replies and one inbound row, and 12 of the 19 Telegram
    message_ids spanning it were unaccounted for. The loss is one-directional --
    a missing inbound row can only ever produce a false "they never replied",
    never a false "answered" -- so the visible cost is the owner being asked a
    question they already answered.

    Deliberately ONLY on the empty outcome: the happy path stays silent, so this
    costs nothing in the common case and every line written is a question worth
    asking. COUNTS ONLY, never message text -- the trace must not become a second
    copy of the transcript.
