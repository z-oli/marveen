"""Live-session open-question drain (heartbeat-driven, NOT a Claude Code hook).

The SessionStart replay (ledger-replay.py) only re-surfaces the open question on
a *respawn*. But a message can be lost in an ALREADY-RUNNING session (a
mid-session channel-deafness gap): ledger-capture.py still records it in
conversation_log, yet the running session never sees it until the next respawn.

This drain runs every ~2 min in the live session (scheduled task
ledger-live-drain) and re-surfaces the still-unanswered inbound so the running
agent answers it WITHOUT waiting for a respawn.

Deterministic + safe:
- GRACE: only surface an open question older than NOW-60s, so we never fight an
  in-flight reply the agent is composing right this moment.
- DEDUP: a statefile next to the ledger DB holds the last surfaced message_id;
  re-surfacing the same id is suppressed (backstop for the surface->reply window,
  so a single missed question is surfaced ONCE, not every tick).
- Never blocks: ANY error -> exit 0, silent (a drain failure must never wedge the
  session or emit noise).

agent_id is derived from the process cwd (generic across channel agents), so the
drain only ever surfaces THIS agent's own open question. When it surfaces one it
writes exactly this block to stdout:

    OPEN_QUESTION chat_id=<id> message_id=<id> source=<plugin:..> reply_tool=<mcp tool>
    <text>

With --precheck (the task's scheduler preCheck, via ledger-live-drain-precheck.sh)
it prints "SKIP" when the drain would surface nothing and nothing at all when it
would, and never writes the statefile. An idle install then spends no model turn
on the ~720 empty ticks a day.
