// Registration-completeness lint for scripts/hooks/.
//
// The recurring defect class this pins: a hook ships fully unit-tested but is
// registered NOWHERE, so it never fires in production while its suite stays
// green -- the reply-guard before #1028 registered its decision logic but not
// the Stop wiring, skill-usage-capture (#607) captured nothing for six weeks,
// and the ledger-live-drain never ran while its docs promised a schedule.
// Each was found by hand. This test finds the next one mechanically: every
// shipped hook script must be referenced by at least one REGISTRATION surface,
// or carry an explicit, reasoned exemption below.
//
// Two directions are enforced:
//   - UNWIRED: a hook that is neither registered nor exempted fails the build,
//     so a new hook cannot ship dead.
//   - STALE EXEMPTION: an exempted hook that IS now registered fails the
//     build, so the exemption list cannot rot into a blind spot -- when an
//     in-flight wiring PR lands, its entry must be deleted here.

// Everywhere a hook can legitimately be wired into production, split by WHO
// the surface configures (TGSABLONHOOK921, 2026-09-21):
//
//   SEEDING surfaces configure every agent this install creates from now on:
//   the settings template each agent is seeded from, the code-side
//   registrations (agent-scaffold), and the two installer scripts.
//
//   CHECKOUT surfaces configure exactly ONE agent -- the one whose session cwd
//   is this checkout, i.e. the main agent -- through the repo's own project
//   settings.
//
// The two are not interchangeable, and the single concatenated corpus this
// lint used to build treated them as if they were: telegram-reply-directive.py
// was registered in .claude/settings.json (one agent) and absent from the
// template (every seeded agent), and the lint stayed green because "somewhere"
// was satisfied by the main agent's own file. Every newly seeded Telegram
// agent started without the hook: it composed its reply, wrote it into its
// tmux pane, never called the reply tool, and the owner saw nothing. An
// external install measured this on two agents (2026-09-11/12 and again after
// a 2026-09-14 image swap wiped a hand wiring the template had never carried).
